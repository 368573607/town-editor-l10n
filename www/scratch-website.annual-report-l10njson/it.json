    "annualReport.messageP1": "Il 2019 è stato un anno di notevoli progressi per Scratch. Abbiamo iniziato l'anno con il lancio di Scratch 3.0, la nuova generazione di Scratch, progettato con lo scopo di stimolare la creatività dei ragazzi e di coinvolgere ragazzi con interessi e ambienti di provenienza diversi. Abbiamo celebrato la fine dell'anno nella nostra nuova sede ora ospitata dalla Scratch Foundation, in un ampio spazio al primo piano vicino a South Station a Boston. Durante tutto l'anno la comunità di Scratch ha continuato a svilupparsi e a crescere: Più di 20 million di giovani hanno creato i loro progetti con Scratch nel 2019, con un aumento del 48% rispetto all'anno precedente.",
    "annualReport.messageP2": "L'impatto e l'importanza di Scratch sono stati evidenziati nel 2020 nel momento in cui la pandemia COVID ha imposto la chiusura delle scuole. L'attività nella comunità online di Scratch è più che raddoppiata nel momento in cui i più giovani, confinati nelle loro abitazioni, si sono rivolti a Scratch per esprimersi in modo creativo e per mettersi in contatto gli uni con gli altri. I membri della comunità sono stati anche attivamente coinvolti nel movimento Black Lives Matter e in altri movimenti che combattono per la giustizia razziale e l'uguaglianza, creando progetti animati e gallerie di progetti per diffondere la consapevolezza e per chiedere il cambiamento.",
    "annualReport.messageP3": "Da momento in cui abbiamo lanciato Scratch nel 2007 abbiamo sempre visto Scratch come qualcosa di più di un linguaggio di programmazione. Scratch fornisce opportunità per tutti i giovani, da qualunque ambiente provengano, di sviluppare la loro voce, di esprimere le proprie idee e di creare gli uni insieme agli altri. Siamo entusiasti di vedere tutti i modo con cui i membri della comunità di Scratch hanno risposto alle recenti sfide della società attraverso la creatività, la collaborazione, il prendersi cura degli altri e la gentilezza.",
    "annualReport.messageP4": "In questo Rapporto Annuale condivideremo con voi la missione, i piani, l'impatto e la diffusione di Scratch, supportati da esempi di come Scratch stia allargando le opportunità di apprendimento per giovani di tutto il mondo anche molto diversi tra loro, sia a scuola che nelle loro vite.
