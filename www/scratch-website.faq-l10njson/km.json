    "faq.remixableBody": "We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.",
    "faq.creativeCommonsTitle": "What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?",
    "faq.creativeCommonsBody": "Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.",
    "faq.fairUseTitle": "Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?",
    "faq.fairUseBody": "If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.",

    "faq.whyAccountBody": "Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).",
    "faq.createAccountTitle": "How can I create an account?",
    "faq.createAccountBody": "Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!",

    "faq.howToConfirmTitle": "How do I confirm my account?",
    "faq.howToConfirmBody": "After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.",

    "faq.requireConfirmBody": "You can still use many aspects of Scratch without confirming your account, including creating and saving projects (without sharing them).",
    "faq.forgotPasswordTitle": "I forgot my username or password. How can I reset it?",
    "faq.forgotPasswordBody": "Enter your username or email address on the {resetLink} page. The website will send an email to the address associated with your username and a link you can use to reset your password.",

    "faq.newScratcherTitle": "How do I transition from 'New Scratcher' to 'Scratcher'?",
    "faq.newScratcherBody": "When you create an account, you’ll be labelled as a “New Scratcher.” To make the transition to \"Scratcher\", you should make and share projects, comment helpfully on other Scratchers’ projects, and be patient! After you’ve met the requirements, a link will appear on your profile page inviting you to become a Scratcher, and you’ll have some additional capabilities on the Scratch website. (Note that we don't promote New Scratchers to Scratcher on request )",
    "faq.multipleAccountTitle": "Can I have more than one account?",
    "faq.multipleAccountBody": "It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.",
    "faq.multipleLoginTitle": "Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?",
    "faq.multipleLoginBody": "This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.",
    "faq.changeUsernameTitle": "Can I change my username?",
    "faq.changeUsernameBody": "The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.",
    "faq.shareInfoTitle": "What information can I share on / with my account?",
    "faq.shareInfoBody": "Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.",
    "faq.deleteAccountTitle": "How do I delete my account?",
    "faq.deleteAccountBody": "Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner. Select \"Account Settings\", then click the \"I want to delete my account\" link at the bottom of the page. But you should only do this if you are absolutely sure that you want to delete your account.",
    "faq.scratchFreeTitle": "Is Scratch free? Can I use it wherever I want?",
    "faq.scratchFreeBody": "Yes! Scratch is available free of charge. You can use it in your school, and you can teach a course about it (even a course that costs money). You don't need to buy a license: it's free!",
    "faq.scratchScreenshotTitle": "Can I use screenshots of Scratch in a book or presentation?",
    "faq.scratchScreenshotBody": "Yes, you can use screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website in a book or presentation, and consider them to be licensed under the {licenseLink} license. We ask that you include a note somewhere in your materials  saying: \"Scratch is a project of the Scratch Foundation, in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.

    "faq.sellProjectsTitle": "Can I sell my Scratch projects?",
    "faq.sellProjectsBody": "Yes: Your Scratch project is your creation. But keep in mind that once you share your project on the Scratch website, everyone is free to download, remix, and reuse the project based on the terms of the {licenseLink} license. So if you intend to sell your project, you may want to un-share it from the Scratch website.",
    "faq.sourceCodeTitle": "Where can I find the source code for Scratch?",
    "faq.sourceCodeBody": "The source code for the Scratch programming editor can be found on {guiLink}. The source code for {flashLink} and {scratch14Link}, are also available on GitHub.

    "faq.reportContentTitle": "What do I do if I see something that’s inappropriate?",
    "faq.reportContentBody": "You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.",
    "faq.noFlameTitle": "What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?",
    "faq.noFlameBody": "Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked. Instead, simply report anything that is disrespectful or unconstructive, and we’ll follow up with the author. We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.",
    "faq.reviewContentTitle": "What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?",
    "faq.reviewContentBody": "The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before",
    "faq.blockedAccountTitle": "What happens when an account is blocked?",
    "faq.blockedAccountBody": "When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.",
    "faq.stolenAccountTitle": "Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?",
    "faq.stolenAccountBody": "You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.",
    "faq.aboutExtensionsTitle": "What are extensions?",
    "faq.aboutExtensionsBody": "In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ",
    "faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle": "How do I add an extension to a project?",
    "faq.howToAddExtensionsBody": "If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions. When you select one of the extensions, a new category of blocks will be added to your project. The extension will be automatically loaded each time your project is opened. You can add multiple extensions to the same project.",
    "faq.createExtensionsTitle": "How do I create my own extension for Scratch",
    "faq.createExtensionsBody": "The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.",
    "faq.scratchXTitle": "What will happen to the ScratchX website?",
    "faq.scratchXBody": "The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0. Once experimental extensions are fully supported in Scratch we will discontinue support for ScratchX and provide developers and users time to transition off of ScratchX to the new extensions platform.",
